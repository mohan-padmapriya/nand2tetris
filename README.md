This repository contains the solutions to the exercises from the self-paced course **Nand2Tetris**, on [Nand2Tetris.org](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).
This course teaches you to build a general-purpose computer system and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up.

Also check out the awesome book that goes alongside the course, Elements of Computing Systems, by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.
